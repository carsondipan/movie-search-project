## Description
This application has been created to give it's USERs the ability to search for movies, provide relevant facts about the films and associated trailers all in one place. Once the USER visits the webpage, they will be brought to screen with only the nav bar visible. A large search bar and button will appear at the top right of the page. The USER will simply enter their desired film's name in the bar and click the yellow search button. The page will then load and display that film's title, release date and official release poster. Once the page has fully loaded, a simple click on the poster will direct the USER to the movie's IMBd page which will allow access to trailers, cast information and more!

OMBd API and IMBd API were used in the programming for this application to function.
